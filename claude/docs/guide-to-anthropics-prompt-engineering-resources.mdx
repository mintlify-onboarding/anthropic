## Getting Started

### Prompt Engineering Tutorial

To start, we recommend you look at our interactive prompting tutorial that teaches basic to advanced prompting techniques for Claude, such as role prompting and hallucination troubleshooting. The tutorial is split into 9 modules, each in a pair of lessons & exercises.

#### Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial

This [interactive version of the prompt engineering tutorial](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19jzLgRruG9kjUQNKtCg1ZjdD6l6weA6qRXG5zLIAhC8/edit?usp=sharing) **requires an API key**.

* If you have an API key, you will need to save a copy to your Google Drive, download the [Claude for Sheets extension](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/claude%5Ffor%5Fsheets/909417792257), and add your API key in order to call Claude in tutorial (in-depth instructions in the first tab)

If you **donâ€™t have an API key**, you can still look at the tutorial and try out exercise solutions within Claude.ai or whatever interface you prefer to use to interact with Claude; or you can reference the answer key below.

#### Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial Answer Key

The [static answer key to our prompt engineering tutorial](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIxjzUWG-6xBVIa2ay6yDpLyeuOh%5FhR%5FZB75a47KX%5FE/edit?usp=sharing) has all answers filled in. There are no calls to Claude made in this document - all text is static.

## In-Depth Prompt Engineering

Below are additional resources that dive deeper into prompt engineering with Claude.

### Claude Prompt Engineering Techniques Presentation

Our [Claude prompt engineering techniques presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zxkSI7lLUBrZycA-%5Fznwqu8DDyVhHLkQGScvzaZrUns/edit?usp=sharing) features **\~100 slides** encompassing beginning to advanced techniques for prompting with Claude, along with troubleshooting techniques (for hallucinations etc.) as well as some direct examples of prompt engineering in action.

> If you are using Claude on Bedrock, we recommend you check out our [Bedrock prompt engineering deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tjvAebcEyR8la3EmVwvjC7PHR8gfSrcsGKfTPAaManw/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

### Prompt Engineering Documentation

This documentation and user guide you're currently reading is full of tips and tricks on troubleshooting, prompt formatting, and ways to access and talk to Claude! Use the lefthand menu to navigate to various pages. Below, we've curated a few links that we think might be of use:

> ### 
> 
> [Configuring GPT prompts for Claude](/claude/docs/configuring-gpt-prompts-for-claude)
> 
> [](/configuring-gpt-prompts-for-claude)

A guide on how to tailor prompts designed for GPT models so they work optimally for Claude.

> ### 
> 
> [Introduction to prompt design](/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design)
> 
> [](/introduction-to-prompt-design)

A leaner, more basic set of information than can be found in our comprehensive prompt engineering techniques presentation, but with more in-line examples and thus perhaps more illustrative than slides alone.

> ### 
> 
> [Constructing a prompt](/claude/docs/constructing-a-prompt)
> 
> [](/constructing-a-prompt)

A high-level overview of some but not all intermediate techniques for prompt construction. While less in-depth than the presentation, it also features in-line examples that exemplify the concepts described.

> ### 
> 
> [Optimizing your prompt](/claude/docs/optimizing-your-prompt)
> 
> [](/optimizing-your-prompt)

An overview of how you can begin thinking about and implementing a process for iterating and evaluating prompts.

## Examples & Code

### Example Prompts & Templates

#### Example Prompts (using Claude for Sheets)

We have a [prompt workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUrBWO0u1-ZuQ8m5gt3-1N5PLR6r%5F%5FUsRsB7WeySDQA/edit?usp=sharing) filled with some starting example prompts based on specific use-cases (one use-case per tab), with some guidance on the prompt engineering techniques that underlie those prompts.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the tasks we cover in the various tabs:

* Simple Q&A
* Information extraction
* Removing PII
* Content generation
* Multiple choice classification
* Dialogue agents and roleplay
* Summarization
* Advanced Q&A on long documents
* Function calling / tool use
* Prompt chains

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> Interactive Version
> 
> If you want to interact with and edit this workbook, you will have to make a copy, download the [Claude for Sheets add-on](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/using-claude-for-sheets), and add your API key following the instructions in the first tab.

#### Example Harmlessness Screens

Harmlessness screens are prompts used to catch prompt injections or prompt misuse as a protective measure; these are usually run in parallel with or before your main prompt. Here is a [workbook of some example harmlessness screens](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPVluQWuDaYgcjDwn30P5rEOsTZcE8YlgFDE1wsWnps/edit#gid=1751817661).

Claude is already quite resilient to prompt injections and bad user behavior, but running parallel or first-line harmlessness screens can reduce the risk even further.

### Example Code & Demos

#### Prompt Engineering Cookbook

Our [prompt engineering cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main) contains recipes in the form of Jupyter notebooks for using Claude in neat and effective ways. The current recipes include:

* [Long Context: Q&A](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/long%5Fcontext/mc%5Fqa.ipynb)
* [Long Context: Wikipedia Search](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/long%5Fcontext/wikipedia-search-cookbook.ipynb)
* [Long Context: PDF "Upload" and Summarization](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/long%5Fcontext/pdf%5Fupload%5Fsummarization.ipynb)

#### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Demo

This [lightweight RAG demo](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-retrieval-demo) uses the Anthropic Python SDK to experiment with Claude's Search and Retrieval capabilities over a variety of knowledge bases (Elasticsearch, vector databases, web search, and Wikipedia).

#### Function Calling / Tool Use Repo

This [tool use demo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-94Fa3HxEMkxkwKppe8lp%5F9-IXXvsvv1) houses our lightweight demo for using tools/function calling with Anthropic models.
