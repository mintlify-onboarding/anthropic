2. **Install the Claude for Sheets extension**  
   1. [Click here](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/claude%5Ffor%5Fsheets/909417792257) to access the Claude for Sheets extension  
   2. Click "Install"
3. **Enable Claude for Sheets**  
   1. Open a fresh workbook  
   2. Go to _Extensions_ \> _Add-ons_ \> _Manage add-ons_

After you see the green 'verified' checkmark ✅ appear, Claude will be activated and ready within your Google Sheet.

#### Permissions

During installation, the Claude for Sheets extension will ask for a variety of permissions needed to function properly. Although the permissions requested to run Claude in Sheets are broad, please be assured that we only process the specific pieces of data that users ask Claude to run on. This data is never used to train our generative models.

Extension permissions include:

* **Connect to an external service** \- needed in order to make calls to the Anthropic API
* **Allow this application to run when you are not present** \- needed to run cell recalculations without user intervention
* **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets spreadsheets** \- needed to perform batch cell updates when recalculating `#ERROR!` cells that have timed out or have been deferred due to API concurrency limits; this service cannot work with permissions given only for the current sheet

<Warning>

**Cell Recalculation**

Note that you must still manually recalculate cells by selecting from the recalculate options within the Claude for Sheets extension menu.

### How to use Claude for Sheets

#### Claude functions

There are two main functions you can use to call Claude using Claude for Sheets:

1. `=CLAUDE(prompt)` \- this function will automatically wrap your prompt in the proper formatting of `\n\nHuman: ${your_prompt}\n\nAssistant:` for you. To use this function, all you need is a plaintext prompt with no additional formatting. This is the function you'll probably want to use most of the time. This is identical to the Slackbot Claude interface and "Chat" mode on the console.  
#### Here is an example CLAUDE prompt     
```text CLAUDE() example
In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?  
````
2. `=CLAUDEFREE(prompt, model, params...)` \- to use this function, you will have to manually sandwich your prompt between `\n\nHuman:` and `\n\nAssistant:`. Replace `\n\n` with two actual new lines when writing your prompt in a cell.  
This is identical to the raw API Claude interface and "Edit Chat" mode on the console. For more information on the special "Human:"/"Assistant:" formatting in CLAUDEFREE, see [Introduction to Prompt Design](/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design).  
   1. To make new lines in a cell, do the following:  
   **Mac:** Cmd + Enter  
   **Windows:** Alt + Enter  
####  Here is an example CLAUDEFREE prompt (notice the two new lines before "Human:")  
```text CLAUDEFREE() example   
Human: In one sentence, what is good about the color blue?  
    
Assistant:  
```

#### Optional function parameters

If you want to specify API parameters, you can do so by listing "parameter name" (in quotation marks), "parameter value" at the end of the call. For example, if you want to set the max\_tokens to 3, you can do it as follows: `=CLAUDE("[your prompt]", "claude-instant-1.2", "max_tokens_to_sample", 3)`.

You can set multiple parameters. Simply list them one after another, each with a name and value pair separated by commas.  
For example, this is valid CLAUDE function: `=CLAUDE("[your prompt]", "claude-instant-1.2", "max_tokens_to_sample", 3, "temperature", 0.5)`

**The parameters you might care about most are:**

* `max_tokens_to_sample` \- the total number of tokens the model outputs before it is forced to stop. For yes/no or multiple choice answers, you probably want 1-2\. Otherwise you'll want as many as 200 if you want a long answer.
* `temperature` \- the amount of randomness injected into results. For multiple-choice or analytical tasks, you'll want it close to 0\. For idea generation, you'll want it set to 1.
