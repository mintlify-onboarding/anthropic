title: "Roleplay Dialogue"
---

Claude is trained to act as a chatbot, but that doesn't mean it has to be a generic conversational chatbot. If you prompt Claude to act in a certain way, it can play a wide variety of different roles with different personalities. This can be used to get Claude to respond in a particular "brand voice".

For each of the following examples, we have provided a version with and a version without a system prompt. For more information regarding the usage of system prompts, see [how to use system prompts](/claude/docs/how-to-use-system-prompts).

## Simple: Career coach

When you want to prompt Claude to act as a chatbot for a specific purpose, give it specific rules about how you want it to interact with users. Here we are limiting its scope to career coaching only, and giving it explicit instructions for how to react to malicious user behavior.

## Complex: Customer support agent

This is a more complex example where Claude is not only following rules for how to interact, but also referencing a specific FAQ document for answering user questions.

We also show the technique of [giving Claude "room to think"](/claude/docs/give-claude-room-to-think-before-responding); in this case priming it with the most relevant information from the document. The XML tags in the response will allow you to easily extract and present just the answer to the user's question.
