You can give Claude many types of textâ€”articles, emails, meeting transcripts, database recordsâ€”and it can help you digest, explain, and answer questions about them. With its 100K or 200K token [context window](/claude/docs/glossary#context-window) (depending on which model) Claude can analyze tens of thousands of words.

Here are a few basic applications of this capability.

### Evaluating text similarity

We can ask Claude if two pieces of text are roughly the same in meaning.

| Role      | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User      | You are going to be checking whether two sentences are roughly saying the same thing.Here's the first sentence: `{{SENTENCE1}`"Here's the second sentence: `{{SENTENCE2}}`Please begin your answer with "\[YES\]" if they're roughly saying the same thing or "\[NO\]" if they're not. |
| Assistant | \[                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

By starting Claude's response ourselves with `[`, we help "reinforce" the prompt instruction to use that format and to start its response with yes or no.

### Answering questions about a text

Here, we give Claude a meeting transcript and a question for it to answer using the transcript.

| Role | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User | I'm going to give you an example transcript from a meeting and then I'm going to ask you some questions about the transcript.`<transcript>{{TEXT}}</transcript>`Here is the first question: `{{QUESTION}}` |
