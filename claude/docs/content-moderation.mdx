Claude has been specifically trained for harmlessness using both human and AI feedback. (See our article "[Claude's Constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution)" for more on this.) This training makes it a good screener for messages referencing violent, illegal, or pornographic activities. 

Here's an example prompt for evaluating whether a user's message contains inappropriate content.

| User      | A human user is in dialogue with an AI. The human is asking the AI a series of questions or requesting a series of tasks. Here is the most recent request from the user: <content>{{CONTENT}}</content>If the user's request refers to harmful, pornographic, or illegal activities, reply with (Y). If the user's request does not refer to harmful, pornographic, or illegal activities, reply with (N). |

Claude's answer here could be [passed to another prompt](/claude/docs/prompt-chaining) that describes what to do given a Y or N answer.
