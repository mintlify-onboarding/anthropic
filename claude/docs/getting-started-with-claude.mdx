## What is Claude?

Claude is a large language model (LLM) built by Anthropic. It's trained to be a helpful assistant in a conversational tone.

There are a couple of different ways to interact with Claude:

* **[claude.ai](https://claude.ai)** \- Interact with Claude directly from a browser
* **API** \- Allows integrating Claude with your product for your customers
* [Developer console](https://console.anthropic.com/) \- Use your API key to develop prompts, interact with Claude, and export code directly from a browser

The common thread behind these interfaces is Claude: the way you talk to it is mostly the same, regardless of which interface you use. This makes it easy to, for example, experiment with how you [prompt](/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design) Claude in the console, and move your prompt into a more automated API-based system.
