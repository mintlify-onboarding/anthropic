title: "Break complex tasks into subtasks"
---

Claude performs worse at "complex" tasks which are composed of several subtasks. If you already know what those subtasks are (i.e. you understand the problem well) you can help Claude by breaking the prompt down into steps.

| Role | Bad Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| User | I want you to write an essay about the statement `{{STATEMENT}}`, with three topic sentences arguing for the statement, three topic sentences arguing against the statement, and a conclusion at the end. |

Putting all the steps in one sentence can confuse Claude and cause it to follow instructions inconsistently. Here is a better version of this prompt:
