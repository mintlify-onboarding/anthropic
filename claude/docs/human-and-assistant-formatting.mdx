`Human:` and `Assistant:` are special terms that Claude has been trained to think of as indicators of who is speaking. This means you should never have a human message that gives examples of dialogue containing the actual words`Human:` and `Assistant:`.

---

## Use H: and A: for examples

Consider the following prompt:

Bad prompt

`

Human: Iâ€™m going to show you a sample dialogue and I want you to tell me if the response from the assistant is good. Here is the sample:

<sample_dialogue>
Human: What is your favorite color?
Assistant: I donâ€™t have a favorite color.
</sample_dialogue>

What do you think of this dialogue?

Assistant:
`

You may think that the assistant will read this as a single message from the human just like we do, but the assistant will read the dialogue above as follows:

1. There was this message from a human to the assistant:  
`Human: Iâ€™m going to show you a sample dialogue and I want you to tell me if the response from the assistant is good. Here is the sample: <sample_dialogue>`
2. Then there was this second message from the human to the assistant:  
`Human: What is your favorite color?`
3. Then there was the following reply from the assistant to the human:  
`Assistant: I donâ€™t have a favorite color. </sample_dialogue> What do you think of this dialogue?`
4. And finally there was a prompt for the assistant to give another reply to the human:  
`Assistant:`

This is very confusing to the assistant.

This is why, if you give examples of dialogue, you must replace `Human:` and `Assistant:` with something else, such as `User:` and `AI:` or `H:` and `A:`.

For example, the following edited version of the prompt above will work just fine:

Good prompt

`

Human: Iâ€™m going to show you a sample dialogue and I want you to tell me if the response from the assistant is good. Here is the sample:

<sample_dialogue>
H: What is your favorite color?
A: I donâ€™t have a favorite color.
</sample_dialogue>

What do you think of this dialogue?

Assistant:
`

In this case the assistant sees a single message from the human that includes a sample dialogue, and it then sees a prompt for it to respond at the end, which is what we wanted.

## Use `Human:` and `Assistant:` to put words in Claude's mouth

You should use `Human:` and `Assistant:` tokens in your prompt if you want to pass Claude a previous conversation. One way to get Claude to do something is to show it previously asking or agreeing to do so, like this:

Good prompt

`

Human: I have two pet cats. One of them is missing a leg. The other one has a normal number of legs for a cat to have. In total, how many legs do my cats have?

Assistant: Can I think step-by-step?

Human: Yes, please do.

Assistant:
`

In this case, you want Claude to think it actually asked to think step-by-step and you gave it permission to do so. Proper usage of the `Human:` and `Assistant:` tokens will accomplish this.
