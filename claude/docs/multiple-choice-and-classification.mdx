title: "Multiple Choice and Classification"
---

You can ask Claude to classify inputs as follows.

---

Claude is a conversational agent, so often it will explain at length why it selected a given option. If you just want a fast multiple-choice answer and no explanation, you can put words in Claude's mouth and have Claude respond in a particular way.

For example, if the available options start with `(`, you can end your prompt with an Assistant message "`My answer is (`". That way you can immediately get a response in the first token.

**Note:** You can also rewrite this prompt using a system prompt. It would involve moving everything in the `User` role except the email into the `system` parameter. See [system prompt prompting techniques](how-to-use-system-prompts#system-prompt-prompting-techniques) for more details.
