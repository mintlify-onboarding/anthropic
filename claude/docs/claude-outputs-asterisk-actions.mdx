title: "Claude outputs asterisk actions"
---

When given a roleplaying prompt or system prompt, Claude sometimes likes to illustrate its response creatively by writing stage directions like `*smiles*` or `*waves*`. If this is undesired, you can post-process the output to remove words in between asterisks. 

An example of how to do this in Python:

Python

`import re

text = "Hello. *My name is Claude. *I am an AI assistant."
cleaned = re.sub(r'\*.*?\*', '', text)
print(cleaned)
> Hello. I am an AI assistant.
`
