title: "Ask Claude to think step-by-step"
description: "If you're asking Claude to perform a complex task that includes many subtasks, it is helpful to [list the subtasks separately](/claude/docs/break-tasks-into-subtasks) ."

When you don't know the subtasks well yourself, i.e. you're asking Claude to solve a problem, you can significantly improve the reasoning and accuracy of the response by explicitly telling Claude to think step-by-step.
