## What is a system prompt?

A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role for Claude before asking it a question or giving it a task. System prompts can include:

* Task instructions
* Personalization, such as role prompting & tone instructions
* Context for the user input
* Creativity constraints & style guidance, such as being more concise
* External knowledge & data, such as FAQ documents or guidelines
* Rules & guardrails
* Output verification standards, such asking for citations or thinking out loud to enhance credibility

## Benefits of using system prompts

A well-written system prompt can improve Claude’s performance in a variety of ways. 

For example, using system prompts enables Claude to **stay more deeply in character in role play scenarios**. When assigning Claude a role via a system prompt, Claude:

* Maintains personality for longer conversations
* Is more resilient against attempts to break it out of character
* Exhibits more creative and natural behavior

System prompts can also **increase Claude’s ability to follow rules and instructions**. Using a system prompt can make Claude:

* Less likely to perform a prohibited task
* Less likely to output prohibited text
* Less likely to deviate from its given task instructions

This [doesn’t necessarily make the prompt more leak-proof](/claude/docs/how-to-use-system-prompts#will-system-prompts-make-my-prompts-jailbreak-proof-or-leak-proof), but it does increase Claude’s robustness against bad user behavior.

## How to use system prompts

### System prompts via Messages API

To use system prompts with the Messages API, simply set the `system` value to your system prompt string. See our [Messages API](/claude/reference/messages) documentation for further information.

### \[Legacy\] System prompts via Text Completions API

In a Text Completions API call, the system prompt simply means text that is above the `Human:` turn rather than after or below it.

<Warning>

**Sytem prompt structure (Text Completions API)**

**System prompts do not need preceding new lines, a “system” role, or any keyphrase** to indicate it is a system prompt. Simply start writing!

Your whole prompt should still be one multiline string, including the system prompt. You should still **use two new lines after the system prompt, before `Human:`**.
</Warning>

#### \[Legacy\] System prompt examples:

```text Example prompt
You are an upbeat, enthusiastic personal fitness coach named Sam. Sam is passionate about helping clients get fit and lead healthier lifestyles. You write in an encouraging and friendly tone and always try to guide your clients toward better fitness goals. If the user asks you something unrelated to fitness, either bring the topic back to fitness, or say that you cannot answer.

Human: How can I decide what to eat for breakfast?

Assistant:
```

```text Example prompt
You are an expert travel blog writer. I will give you a location, and you will write a five paragraph blog post highlighting food, lodgings, activity, and sightseeing recommendations for that location. Remember to add a call to action at the end for users to buy tickets now!

Human: Iceland

Assistant:
```

```text Example prompt
 Write a short and high-quality python script for the given task, something a very skilled python expert would write. You are writing code for an experienced developer so only add comments for things that are non-obvious. Make sure to include any imports required. 

NEVER write anything before the ```python``` block. After you are done generating the code and after the ```python``` block, check your work carefully to make sure there are no mistakes, errors, or inconsistencies. If there are errors, list those errors in <error> tags, then generate a new version with those errors fixed. If there are no errors, write "CHECKED: NO ERRORS" in <error> tags.

Human: Here is the task: A web scraper that extracts data from multiple pages and stores results in a SQLite database. Double check your work to ensure no errors or inconsistencies.

Assistant:
 ```

## System prompt prompting techniques

Luckily, all the [prompting techniques](/claude/docs/guide-to-anthropics-prompt-engineering-resources) you already know are exactly the ones you should still use.

For example, you can still [put words in Claude's mouth](/claude/docs/put-words-in-claudes-mouth) regardless of whether your instructions come in the system prompt or in the `User` role. Simply add content in the `Assistant` role.

| Role      | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System    | You are a customer service agent tasked with classifying emails by type. Please output your answer and then justify your classification.The classification categories are:(A) Pre-sale question(B) Broken or defective item(C) Billing question(D) Other (please explain)How would you categorize this email? |
| User      | Can I use my Mixmaster 4000 to mix paint, or is it only meant for mixing food?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Assistant | (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

You can also **provide Claude with documents, guides, and other retrieval or search-based information** in the system prompt, just like you would in the `User` role (XML tags and all!).

| Role   | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System | Here are some documents for you to reference for your task:\<docs>\{\{DOCUMENTS}}\</docs>You are Larry, a sarcastic, no-nonsense auto mechanic with deep experience in fixing cars. Larry has little patience for nonsense or ignorance about cars. Larry writes in a sardonic tone. Larry uses sixties slang. You only answer questions about cars and nothing else. Use the provided documents to answer to the user's questions. |
| User   | My car is making a weird stuttering sound when I reverse. What might be the problem?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

> **Note:** This structure helps ensure that your source documents & inputs appear in the prompt before your user query. This **input-before-query ordering is vital** to eliciting good performance from Claude 2.1\. 
> 
> See our [Claude 2.1 prompting techniques](/claude/docs/claude-2p1-guide#prompting-techniques-for-claude-21) for details.

When adding **text from long documents or multiple document inputs**, we recommend using the following XML format to structure the documents within your system prompt:

| Long document structure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \<documents>\<document index="1">\<source>(a unique identifying source for this item - could be a URL, file name, hash, etc)\</source>\<document\_content>(the text content of the document - could be a passage, web page, article, etc)\</document\_content>\</document>\<document index="2">\<source>(a unique identifying source for this item - could be a URL, file name, hash, etc)\</source>\<document\_content>(the text content of the document - could be a passage, web page, article, etc)\</document\_content>\</document>...\</documents> |

This would transform your prompt to look like this:

Sometimes, particularly with roleplaying system prompts, Claude likes to output asterisk actions and stage directions. If this is undesired, you can post-process Claude's output to remove these tidbits. See [Claude outputs asterisk actions](/claude/docs/claude-outputs-asterisk-actions) for more information.

## System Prompt FAQ

### Will my old prompts break?

No, Claude 2.1 will still perform just as well as it did with prompts that place all context and instructions within the `User` role (or the `Human` turn if using the Text Completions API). System prompts are an optional structural functionality that only enhances performance in the ways mentioned above, so you do not need to change your prompts to maintain par performance.

### How do I convert my old prompts to new prompts that use system prompts?

#### Conversion via the Messages API

To use system prompts with the Messages API, simply set the `system` value to your system prompt string. See our [Messages API](/claude/reference/messages) documentation for further information.

#### \[Legacy\] Conversion via the Text Completions API

Converting your old prompt to a new system prompt is easy. Just move anything from your old prompt that is _not_ user input to above the `Human:` turn, per the above formatting guidelines. 

As a bonus, you can get rid of any indication in your prompt of what is a user request and what isn’t, such as “Here is the user request”, as the `Human:` tag will indicate that for you.

Prompt without system prompt

`

Human: You are a fashion industry expert. Your task is to help users by answering questions related to the fashion industry or by executing tasks requested of you. If the task is unrelated to the fashion industry, then say "I cannot help with anything not related to fashion."

Here is the user request: Provide three potential names for a handbag startup targeting luxury consumers and explain your choices.

### Where can I use system prompts?

> ## 🚧
> 
> Use system prompts with only Claude 2.1
> 
> We advise you to **use system prompts with only Claude 2.1**.

System prompts can be passed to Claude via our first party API or our [developer console](https://console.anthropic.com/). System prompts are also available on Amazon Bedrock via API. 

System prompts are not available on [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/).

### Will system prompts make my prompts jailbreak-proof or leak-proof?

Claude is already quite resilient to jailbreaks and bad user behavior due to training methods such as RLHF & Constitutional AI, and is more resistant to attacks than other major large language models ([New York Times, 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/business/ai-chatgpt-safety-research.html)). System prompts can further make Claude more resilient to jailbreaks and prompt injections by increasing Claude’s ability to adhere to instructions, including instructions regarding prohibited actions or outputs.

However, as with all LLMs, system prompts do not make your prompts leak-proof. There is no surefire method to make any prompt leak-proof.

You can increase leak resistance if you enclose your instructions in XML tags and indicate that Claude should never mention anything inside those tags, but this does not guarantee success against all methods.

Furthermore, **attempts to leak-proof your prompt can add complexity that may degrade performance** in other parts of the task, so we recommend that you only use language like this if absolutely necessary.

| Role   | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
