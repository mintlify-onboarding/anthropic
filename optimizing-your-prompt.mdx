title: "Optimizing your prompt"
descirption: "Once you have a prompt template you are happy with, it's time to start testing it. Then (if needed) you can improve your prompt based on how Claude performs on the tests."
---

Here are recommended steps for testing and iterating on your prompt template.

## Gather a diverse set of example inputs

It is good to test your prompt with sets of inputs that are representative of the real-world data you will be asking Claude to process. Be sure to include any difficult inputs or edge cases that Claude may encounter.

Testing your prompt with these inputs can approximate how well Claude will perform "in the field". It can also help you see where Claude is having difficulties. 

It's good to get as many inputs as you're willing to read through when developing the prompt template; we recommend at least 20 or more, depending on the task.

### Set aside ("hold out") a test set of inputs

When coming up with inputs to test, we recommend having separate sets of "prompt development data" and "test data". Both (or more) sets should be representative of real inputs.

Use your prompt development data to evaluate how well Claude is performing the task as you develop your prompt. Iterate on your prompt until Claude is consistently performing well with this data.

Then, to ensure that you're not overfitting to just the prompt development data, you can prompt Claude to complete the task with the test data that it has not yet encountered.

### (Optional) Generate synthetic data

If you want more input data but don't have a lot of it yet, you can prompt a separate instance of Claude to generate additional input text for you to test on! If you explain what good input data looks like and then give a few examples, you can often get more such examples from Claude.

## Experiment and iterate

Refining a prompt can be a lot like performing a series of experiments. You run tests, interpret the results, then adjust a variable (your prompt, or the input) based on the results.

When Claude fails a test, try to identify why it failed (having Claude output its thinking in  tags is a great way to look into Claude's logic; learn more in our tip for [giving Claude room to think](/claude/docs/give-claude-room-to-think-before-responding)). Adjust your prompt to account for that failure point.

Adjusting your prompt can involve:

* Writing rules more explicitly or adding new rules
* Showing Claude how to process your examples correctly in the prompt itself by adding similar examples and canonical outputs for them to the prompt.

When Claude is doing consistently well at one type of input with the new prompt, try it with another input type. Make sure to try out edge cases.

Add rules and examples to your prompt to until you get good performance on your representative set of inputs. We recommend also performing a ["hold-out test"](/claude/docs/optimizing-your-prompt#set-aside-hold-out-a-test-set-of-inputs).

## Bonus: Ask Claude to evaluate its outputs

You can use Claude to "self-evaluate" answers it has previously given.

For example, you can:

* Get the model to check its work if you think it might have made mistakes
* Add an extra diligence step to a task
* Classify responses as good or bad, or say which of two initial responses it prefers and why, given your instructions (e.g. so that you can decide which one to use)

In the following example, we are asking Claude to find any grammar mistakes in a given text.

| Role | Prompt                                                                                                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| User | Here is an article, contained in \<article> tags:\<article>\{\{ARTICLE}}\</article>Please identify any grammatical errors in the article. |

Here's a possible response:

| Role      | Response                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assistant | 1\. There is a missing fullstop in the first sentence.2\. The word "their" is misspelled as "they're" in the third sentence. |

In case Claude failed to identify some errors in the first attempt, you could try adding a second pass:

| Role | Prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| User | Here is an article, contained in \<article> tags:\<article>\{\{ARTICLE}}\</article>Please identify any grammatical errors in the article that are missing from the following list:\<list>1. There is a missing fullstop in the first sentence.2\. The word "their" is misspelled as "they're" in the third sentence.\</list>If there are no errors in the article that are missing from the list, say "There are no additional errors." |

You can perform "extra diligence" steps like this automatically by [prompt chaining](/claude/docs/prompt-chaining).

<Tip>

**Avoiding hallucinations**

When asking Claude to find something in a text, it's good practice to "give it an out" by describing what to do if there's nothing matching the description in the prompt. This can help prevent it from making something up in order to give an answer.
